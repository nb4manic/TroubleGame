Wrap board move in another function?

def victory_paths()

    while red_piece.coordinate != [1, 4]
        OR (AKA)
    while current_piece.coordinates != current_player.pivot_coordinate:
        board_move


    if (move_roll + piece.coordinate) > win_coordinates[-1]:
        can't make that move! select another piece
        break  # insert check to make sure piece was moved during turn

    if (move_roll + piece.coordinates) < win_coordinates[-1]:
        board_move

    if (move_roll + piece.coordinates) == win_coordinates[-1]:
        board_move
        del player.win_spaces[-1]
